# Specs and pseudocode for jQuery.hlf.tip & jQuery.hlf.snapTip

For current (and future)* set of [title] elements and their context element, create a tip. The tip api is stored in the context element.*


## Toggling behavior:

Valid mouseenter is when the mouse state has not changed from enter in t duration. Any leaving makes it invalid. Valid mouseleave is if the event came from the current trigger. Toggling cannot happen concurrently, and neither can the animations.

If mouseenter is valid
	If new trigger
		Update tip content
		Update reference to current trigger
	  If tip is not locked then update tip offset with mouse event data
	If not visible and not locked
		Stop running animations and show tip
		Lock tip from showing until tip is shown
			Update the initial offset with mouse event data
		Update tip offset when shown

If mouseleave is valid and visible and not locked
	Stop running animations and hide tip
	Lock tip from sleeping until tip is hidden


## Tracking & snapping behavior

When mousemove
	If tip is visible then update tip offset

To update offset*
	Start with the current mouse position, ref either global or event
		If snapping to trigger then use the trigger's inclusive-offset as initial offset
		If snapping to track horizontally then use the intial offset y value
		If snapping to track vertically then use the initial offset x value
	Apply the direction offsets*
		If north then shift the tip up the combined tip and trigger height
		If south then shift the tip down the trigger height
		If west then shift the tip left the combined tip and trigger width
		If east then shift the tip right the trigger width
	Apply center offsets for snapping
		If tracking horizontally then shift the tip left half its width
		If tracking vertically then shift the tip up half its height


## Suggested tip dom structure

An inner wrap, a stem, a content area. 

The content area shifts its margin according to where the stem is positioned. The stem can be drawn with border width and positioned absolutely. 

The stem should support nine directions. For the corners, the stem is square. For the sides, the stem has a wider base.
